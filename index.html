    <p text-align="center">Now that plant-based remedies are more accessible in the U.S — legally — than ever before, people have greater natural options to treat their health conditions. With science and legislation behind us, Greenbuds are proud to supply clinically-backed greener treatments for a wealth of health issues, including pain and inflammation.
    <br><br>In 2737BC, Emperor Shen Neng prescribed natural herbs for the treatment of rheumatism, gout, thiamin deficiency, malaria and memory issues. This ancient Chinese medicine soon spread throughout the world, to almost every continent, and has been prescribed for a wealth of mental, physical and spiritual maladies ever since.

    <div class="text"><p><span class="heading">Pain</span><br>Our guides can recommend clinically-proven, safe, natural products that have been used for centuries to help reduce pain. Natural painkillers are popular alternatives to artificial, addictive and potentially harmful opioids. Clients suffering from acute headaches, muscular and back pain, or chronic pain conditions find relief with our products. In fact, according to a meta-analysis conducted by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, pain was the #1 reason users sought these remedies. It further showed they were correct in doing so, with substantive evidence to support the use of such products in the treatment of chronic pain.  </div>

    <div class="text"><p><span class="heading">Inflammation</span><br>Ever since Emperor Shen Neng prescribed natural remedies for gout and rheumatic complaints (arthritis), his herbs have been used to reduce inflammation. Western science continues to prove the anti-inflammatory properties of these natural remedies, with clinical trials separating the psychotropic and physical effects of the plant for increased effectiveness. The result? More and more US doctors are recommending green alternatives to patients suffering from inflammation.

    <div class="text"><p><span class="heading">Rheumatism and Arthritis</span><br>Our plant-based products can also help soothe the symptoms of arthritic and rheumatic conditions. Inhaled or eaten, our products can help relieve the pain and inflammation associated with these conditions, and external balms are also available. Long-term sufferers prefer Portland’s plant-based products over opiates. For chronic conditions, our products are as effective as opiates and NSAIDS, but without the concomitant risk of overdose, addiction or long-term consequences.

    <div class="text"><p><span class="heading">Stress</span><br>Studies have shown the positive effects our natural remedies can have on stress, while others suggest that similar products may be beneficial for focus.

    <div class="text"><p><span class="heading">Depression</span><br>
    While some of our products are used to relax and unwind, others are taken to elate and uplift. Because of this, a number of clients have found relief from depressive symptoms with controlled use of our remedies. Daytime strains can help return joie de vivre, energising and invigorating sufferers of depression. While other antidepressants can leave users feeling tired or sluggish, we offer alternatives that can incite creativity, energy and feelings of freedom.
